# TargetBridge

Apple dropped Target Display Mode in late 2014 with the 5K iMac — and it never came back.

TargetBridge brings it back via software, streaming your screen at up to 5K over a direct Thunderbolt connection, e.g. to an iMac.

It's free and open source software, no subscription and no dongle required.

> **2017 iMac 5K appliance branch:** this private development branch adds a
> dedicated lossless DPCM/Metal path and plug-in launch agents for a 2017
> 27-inch 5K iMac. It is not the upstream prebuilt release. Start with the
> [2017 iMac overview](docs/iMac-2017-5K.md), follow the
> [reproduction/install guide](docs/repro/imac-2017-5K/README.md), and read the
> [plain-language engineering account](docs/blog/imac-2017-5k-software-display.md).
> Until the final hardware result linked there passes, treat it as an appliance
> experiment rather than an official TargetBridge release.

## Support and Thanks

TargetBridge is free and open source. Sponsorship is never required, but monthly
and one-time contributions make it possible to reserve time for macOS
compatibility, bug fixes, hardware testing, and future useful tools for Mac.

Thank you to everyone supporting TargetBridge through GitHub Sponsors. Your
contributions help keep the project moving forward.

## Contributors

Thank you to everyone who tests TargetBridge on real hardware, reports issues,
and improves the project. A special thank-you for this release goes to:

- [@aalpgiray](https://github.com/aalpgiray) for receiver brightness, volume, Night Shift, and True Tone controls.
- [@preggocl](https://github.com/preggocl) for the physical Receiver display profile and the software decode fallback.
- [@Betafer](https://github.com/Betafer) for input-queue safety and the low-latency Receiver Master cursor overlay.

## TargetBridge 3.5.1

TargetBridge 3.5.1 is a maintenance release focused on safer input control,
accurate Receiver display profiles, and improved compatibility with older Macs:

- preserve keyboard and mouse release events when the Receiver input queue is under pressure
- use the low-latency cursor overlay in Receiver Master mode to avoid duplicate cursors
- advertise the Receiver's actual panel geometry instead of always reporting a fixed 5K profile
- fall back safely to software video decode when VideoToolbox cannot decode a stream on older hardware

It also keeps the established multi-Mac workspace features:

- mirror mode and extended desktop mode
- multiple receivers from one sender
- experimental `Network Link` transport in addition to Thunderbolt Bridge
- streamed system audio
- shared JSON localization for Sender and Receiver
- official manifest-based addons
- `Input Dockstation` with master/slave keyboard and mouse control
- text clipboard sync tied to the active input master
- remote brightness control from the sender
- automatic receiver discovery and extended-layout restore
- remote connection automation via URL scheme, CLI wrapper, launch args, and SSH recipes
- remembers the selected virtual-display resolution for each receiver
- configurable Receiver Master shortcuts, including protected macOS shortcuts such as Space switching
- mock sender, parser tests, and a loopback smoke test for Receiver resilience without a second Mac
- improved direct `Duplicate Desktop` startup, with a short wait for the virtual display to become available
- permission cards refresh when TargetBridge returns from macOS Privacy & Security settings
- Receiver stays on its waiting screen until a real session starts, avoiding a distracting fullscreen flash
- experimental `5K 60` profile for recent Apple Silicon; use `5K 48` for the most stable work sessions

## Core Features

- Sender can stream either a mirrored desktop or an extended virtual display. See [Display Modes](docs/Features.md#display-modes).
- One sender can drive multiple receiver Macs over separate cables. See [Multi-Receiver Workflows](docs/Features.md#multi-receiver-workflows).
- Stream profiles range from `2560 x 1440` to `5120 x 2880` with H.264/HEVC selection based on capability. `5K 60` is an experimental profile for recent Apple Silicon; `5K 48` remains recommended for reliable daily work. See [Display Modes](docs/Features.md#display-modes).
- Receiver discovery is automatic over Bonjour. Extended-display arrangement is remembered per receiver when possible. See [Display Modes](docs/Features.md#display-modes).
- Thunderbolt Bridge remains the primary low-latency path, with `Network Link` available as an experimental addon-gated transport. See [Network Link](docs/Features.md#network-link-experimental).
- The Sender menu can control a connected receiver's brightness, volume, Night Shift, and True Tone when supported. See [Receiver Device Controls](docs/Features.md#receiver-device-controls).

## Official Addons

TargetBridge now has a conservative manifest-based addon system. Official manifests ship with the app, and user manifests can be imported from the settings UI.

- `Network Link`: local Ethernet/Wi-Fi transport path for the same display pipeline. See [docs/Addons.md#official-addons](docs/Addons.md#official-addons) and [Network Link](docs/Features.md#network-link-experimental).
- `Audio Relay`: streamed system audio from sender to receiver. See [docs/audio.md](docs/audio.md) and [docs/Addons.md#official-addons](docs/Addons.md#official-addons).
- `Input Dockstation`: keyboard/mouse relay, master/slave roles, slave switching, and text clipboard sync. See [docs/Addons.md#input-dockstation](docs/Addons.md#input-dockstation) and [Input Dockstation](docs/Features.md#input-dockstation).

## Requirements

- Sender: Apple Silicon Mac (M1 or later) or Intel Mac, macOS 14 Sonoma or later. Apple Silicon remains the primary tested path; Intel Sender builds are available for broader testing.
- Receiver: Intel or Apple Silicon Mac, macOS 11 Big Sur or later
- Thunderbolt cable
- See also [docs/Hardware.md](docs/Hardware.md) for hardware details, tested cables, adapters, and Thunderbolt networking ideas.

> **"App is damaged" warning?** macOS quarantines unsigned apps downloaded from the browser. Run this in Terminal, then try again:
> ```bash

> xattr -cr ~/Downloads/TargetBridge-Receiver-arm64.app
> xattr -cr ~/Downloads/TargetBridge-Receiver-x86_64.app
> ```

## Permissions

- Sender usually needs `Screen Recording`.
- `Input Dockstation` may also require `Accessibility` and `Input Monitoring`, depending on the active role.
- Receiver may require `Accessibility` or `Input Monitoring` when it participates in input relay.
- In practice, `Input Dockstation` is a two-sided feature: one Mac captures input, the other injects it, so permissions may be needed on both Sender and Receiver.
- See [docs/Addons.md#input-dockstation](docs/Addons.md#input-dockstation) for the permission matrix.
