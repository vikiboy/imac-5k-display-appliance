# Testing the iMac 5K Display Appliance Without Hardware

Everything on this page runs on one Mac with **no Thunderbolt cable, no
second machine, and no Apple Silicon requirement** (except where noted).
CI runs the first three suites on every push/PR.

## 1. Sender unit tests (Swift)

Covers the wire protocol (framing, corrupt-length rejection, unknown-type
skipping, input-event encoder parity with `JSONDecoder`), the discovered-
receiver model (which IP is dialed per transport), connection diagnostics
(link-local interface scoping, failure-detail composition), and the
automation parsers behind `targetbridge://` URLs and `--connect` launch args.

```bash
cd TargetBridge-Sender
xcodegen generate     # only needed after changing project.yml or adding files
xcodebuild test -project TargetBridge.xcodeproj -scheme TBDisplaySender -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

Test sources live in `TargetBridge-Sender/TBDisplaySenderTests/`.

## 2. Appliance installer lifecycle tests (zsh)

Exercises the real sender installer and uninstaller against isolated fake
`defaults` and `launchctl` tools. It proves the lossless Thunderbolt launch
contract and verifies that TargetBridge's display-sleep preference is backed
up once, changed reversibly, never overwrites a later user choice, and fails
closed when recovery metadata is corrupt. It does not touch the running app,
the developer's preferences, or launchd domain.

```bash
TargetBridge-Sender/tests/test_appliance_installer_contract.zsh \
  TargetBridge-Sender/scripts/install_targetbridge_5k_sender_launch_agent.sh
TargetBridge-Sender/tests/test_local_app_installer.zsh
/bin/zsh TargetBridge-Sender/tests/test_signing_identity_continuity.zsh
TargetBridge-Sender/tests/test_stable_signing_contract.zsh
TargetBridge-Sender/tests/test_sleep_preference_lifecycle.zsh
/bin/zsh TargetBridge-Sender/tests/test_display_lifecycle_protocol.zsh
TargetBridge-Sender/tests/test_heartbeat_common_mode.zsh
TargetBridge-Sender/tests/test_pre_profile_reconnect_contract.zsh
```

The local-app and stable-signing contracts prove that production installation
rejects ad-hoc sender identities, preserves staged/installed executable bytes,
and requires a certificate-backed designated requirement. The last two
contracts keep the parked-session heartbeat active during AppKit
event tracking and verify that the wake-broker handoff is finite, shared by GUI
and automation, capture-free, and unable to reset the outer backoff before a
real display profile is negotiated.

## 3. Receiver parser and appliance tests (C, Objective-C, and zsh)

Unit tests for the streaming packet parser in `net.c` — fragmented and
contiguous feeds, the NUL-sentinel guarantee, corrupt/oversized length
rejection, and multi-megabyte payloads fed in socket-sized chunks.
Pure POSIX: needs **no ffmpeg, SDL, or pkgconf**.

```bash
cd TargetBridge-Receiver/TBReceiverC
make test
```

Test sources live in `TargetBridge-Receiver/TBReceiverC/tests/`.

## 4. Mock sender (protocol-level fault injection)

`TargetBridge-Receiver/TBReceiverC/tests/mock_sender.py` (stdlib-only
Python 3) speaks the full wire protocol against a running receiver:

| Mode        | What it exercises                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `handshake` | HELLO / heartbeat / TEARDOWN lifecycle                          |
| `stream`    | PARAM_SETS + AVCC H.264 frames (generated via the ffmpeg CLI)   |
| `hang`      | idle watchdog: silent sender is reaped after ~10s               |
| `badlen`    | parser rejects a corrupt `0xFFFFFFFF` length and disconnects    |
| `drop`      | abrupt mid-packet disconnect returns receiver to waiting        |

```bash
# terminal 1
cd TargetBridge-Receiver/TBReceiverC && make && ./tbreceiver --windowed

# terminal 2
python3 TargetBridge-Receiver/TBReceiverC/tests/mock_sender.py --mode stream --duration 5
```

## 5. Loopback smoke test (one command)

Builds the receiver, launches it windowed, and drives all mock-sender
phases with pass/fail assertions on the receiver's log:

```bash
TargetBridge-Receiver/scripts/loopback_smoke.sh            # full run
TargetBridge-Receiver/scripts/loopback_smoke.sh --no-stream  # skip the H.264 phase
```

Needs a GUI session (an SDL window opens briefly) and the receiver build
deps (`brew install ffmpeg sdl2 pkgconf`), so it is a local dev tool rather
than a CI job.

## 6. Real sender ↔ receiver on one Mac (no cable)

The receiver binds `0.0.0.0:54321` and accepts any peer, so an Apple
Silicon Mac can stream to a receiver running on itself over the LAN
interface (the sender refuses `127.0.0.1`, so use the machine's own LAN IP
for both ends):

```bash
open build/TargetBridge.app   # sender: pick the LAN interface, enter the Mac's own LAN IP
./tbreceiver --windowed       # receiver on the same Mac
```

This exercises the true capture → encode → decode → render path minus the
Thunderbolt link itself.

## Debugging a live connection

The sender logs its connection lifecycle (dial target, interface, waiting/
failed states, timeouts) to unified logging:

```bash
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.vikiboy.imac5kdisplay.sender"'
```

The receiver logs to stderr; under the LaunchAgent that lands in
`~/Library/Logs/TargetBridgeReceiver.launchd.err.log`.

## Experimental 5K with a 60 FPS target

`native5k60Experimental` is an opt-in HEVC profile for testing recent Apple
Silicon encoders at 5120 x 2880 with a requested 60 FPS capture/encode target.
It does not alter the stable 5K profile, which retains a 48 FPS target and is
the recommended choice for daily work. Selecting either profile proves only the
requested topology and target, not the receiver's physical presentation cadence.

Real-world M4 testing has reached 56-57 FPS but also showed temporary drops
under mixed workloads and added heat when Input Dockstation is active. Treat
this profile as a benchmark and feedback tool, not a guaranteed 60 FPS capture,
transport, or physical-presentation result.

Use it only for a test session, either from the Sender's stream-profile picker
or with the automation alias:

```bash
targetbridge connect --receiver <receiver-ip> --mode extended --preset 5k60
```

After at least one minute of normal desktop use, note the Sender FPS shown in
the session card, whether input remains responsive, and any capture or decoder
errors. Label that number as sender telemetry; it is not a receiver presentation
count. For a two-receiver experiment, start one session per receiver and record
the sender telemetry for each session separately. Include the sender model,
macOS version, receiver model, cable type, and selected transport with the
report.
