/* tb_dpcm.h — TBD2, a lossless tile-DPCM wire format for 4:4:4 frames.
 *
 * PROVENANCE
 *
 * This implementation integrates and hardens the TBD1/TBD2 work developed by
 * Aykut Alpgiray Ates in TargetBridge PR #158. See the repository NOTICE.md
 * for the exact upstream pull request and commit links.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The receiver spends 23.4 ms of a 36 ms frame just pulling bytes off the wire
 * (single-core cost inside the TCP stack, measured), and another 12.9 ms pushing
 * the same bytes across PCIe to the GPU. Both costs are proportional to frame
 * size, so the cheapest way to raise the frame rate is to send fewer bytes.
 * Damage rectangles already handle the case where little changed; this handles
 * the case they cannot — fullscreen video and fast scrolling, where most of the
 * screen genuinely is new every frame and the sender falls back to full frames.
 *
 * Measured on real content (see the ratio probe): 2.96x on a 36-megapixel photo,
 * which is close to worst case, 4.5x on text-heavy UI, 13.8x on ordinary window
 * chrome. LZFSE on the same photo gets 3.48x, so this captures 85% of what a
 * real entropy coder finds, at a small fraction of the cost. It is LOSSLESS —
 * every output sample is bit-identical to the input.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF THE FORMAT, AND WHY
 *
 * DPCM is inherently serial: each residual is relative to the pixel before it,
 * so a decoder cannot start pixel N before finishing pixel N-1. That is fatal on
 * a GPU, and the receiver's GPU is the only spare compute it has (its CPU cores
 * are already the bottleneck). So the frame is cut into 8x8 tiles that are
 * FULLY INDEPENDENT: each carries its own seed pixel and its own bit widths, and
 * needs nothing from any neighbour. One GPU threadgroup per tile, 230400 of them
 * at 5K, which is the shape a GPU wants.
 *
 * 8x8 was measured, not guessed. 4x4 wins marginally on dense text (4.71x vs
 * 4.46x) but loses badly on flat content (9.7x vs 13.8x) because it pays four
 * times the per-tile overhead where there is nothing to code. 16x16 loses
 * everywhere: one high-contrast edge sets the bit width for 256 pixels.
 *
 * The predictor is the left neighbour, with the first column predicting from
 * above. JPEG-LS's median-edge predictor was measured too and ties it to within
 * 1% on every frame tested, including the photo — inside an 8x8 tile there is
 * not enough vertical run for it to earn its three extra loads and a clamp.
 *
 * Residuals are taken modulo the sample range (256 or 1024) and re-centred, so
 * reconstruction wraps and stays exact. Zigzagged, the widest possible residual
 * needs exactly the sample depth — the same as a raw sample — so a tile can
 * never expand beyond its header, and no escape hatch is needed for
 * pathological content.
 *
 * TWO SAMPLE DEPTHS
 *
 * 8-bit codes the three bytes of a BGRA8888 pixel; 10-bit codes the three
 * fields of an ARGB2101010LE ('l10r') pixel. 10-bit exists because of a
 * measured artefact of the capture path: the virtual display's framebuffer is
 * 8-bit, but the capture-side conversion to Display P3 manufactures sub-8-bit
 * detail on its way into the 10-bit container, and on the panel that detail is
 * the difference between a smooth gradient and a banded one. A codec that only
 * carried 8 bits would permanently trade that quality away for speed.
 *
 * Payload lengths vary per tile, so a decoder needs to know where its tile
 * starts. Shipping an offset per tile would cost 4 bytes x 230400 = 921 KB, which
 * would wreck the ratio on the flat frames where the win is largest. Instead
 * tiles are grouped 64 at a time with one base offset per group, and each
 * threadgroup recovers its members' offsets with a 64-element scan in
 * threadgroup memory. The group table costs 14 KB at 5K, and the wire carries no
 * per-tile offsets at all.
 *
 * Each group's payload starts on a BYTE boundary (the base offsets in the table
 * are still expressed in bits, but are always multiples of 8). This costs at
 * most 7 bits per group — ~3 KB a frame — and is what makes the ENCODER
 * parallel: two threads packing adjacent groups never share a byte, so groups
 * can be written concurrently. Within a group, residuals are packed with no
 * padding and concurrent writers must merge (the GPU encoder uses atomic OR).
 * The width and seed planes are padded to 4-byte multiples for the same reason:
 * every section a GPU touches starts at an offset it can address as words.
 *
 * BYTE ORDER
 *
 * Everything inside a blob is LITTLE-endian, unlike the enclosing TB packet
 * header, which stays big-endian as it always was. This is deliberate: the blob
 * is produced and consumed by GPUs on little-endian machines, and byte-swapping
 * the group table (or swizzling in the shaders) would be pure waste. The blob
 * is opaque to the packet layer.
