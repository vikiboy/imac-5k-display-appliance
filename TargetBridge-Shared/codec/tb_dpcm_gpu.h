/* tb_dpcm_gpu.h — TBD2 encoder on the GPU.
 *
 * Provenance: this derivative integrates and hardens the GPU codec work from
 * Aykut Alpgiray Ates's TargetBridge PR #158. Exact links are in NOTICE.md.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT ON THE CPU
 *
 * The reference encoder in tb_dpcm.c costs ~95 ms/frame single-threaded at 5K.
 * Spread over the sender's performance cores it would reach roughly 12 ms, which
 * fits 60 Hz on paper — and is the wrong answer anyway. The sender is the
 * machine somebody is actually using, and spending most of eight cores on video
 * compression to drive a second display is exactly the cost this whole feature
 * exists to avoid. The GPU is idle by comparison.
 *
 * WHY IT IS THREE STEPS
 *
 * No tile's payload position is known until every earlier tile's bit widths are,
 * so the work splits at that dependency:
 *
 *   1. analyze  (GPU)  one threadgroup per tile, one thread per pixel: compute
 *                      every residual, reduce to a bit width per channel, and
 *                      record the tile's seed and its total bit cost.
 *   2. plan     (CPU)  prefix-sum the per-tile costs into the group table and
 *                      each tile's bit offset, and pack the width nibbles. This
 *                      is O(tiles), 1/64th of the per-pixel work, and the host
 *                      has to write the header and read the final length anyway.
 *   3. pack     (GPU)  one thread per (tile, channel), each packing a contiguous
 *                      run of residuals into the payload.
 *
 * Encoding is embarrassingly parallel in a way decoding is not: the encoder
 * predicts from ORIGINAL samples, never reconstructed ones, so no pixel waits on
 * its neighbour. The decoder's prefix-sum trick is unnecessary here.
 *
 * Step 3 needs care about one thing only. Residuals are bit-packed with no
 * padding inside a group, so neighbouring threads share the words at the ends of
 * their runs. Each thread therefore accumulates into a register and writes whole
 * 32-bit words it owns outright, using an atomic OR for just the first and last
 * word of its run — two atomics per thread instead of two per residual, which is
 * 1.4 million rather than 66 million at 5K. Group byte-alignment (see tb_dpcm.h)
 * is what keeps that boundary sharing local to a group.

} tb_dpcm_gpu_band;

/* Encode `band_count` equal horizontal bands of `band_h` rows each, in TWO GPU
 * round trips for the whole frame instead of two per band.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * tb_dpcm_gpu_encode() blocks twice — once after analyze, once after pack —
 * because step 2 runs on the host between them. Calling it once per band made
 * that 2N blocking waits, and the cost is not the GPU work (which is identical)
 * but the wait itself: each one is a kernel round trip whose latency depends on
 * what else is queued on the device. The sender shares the GPU with WindowServer
 * and with whatever the user is watching, so an unlucky wait can be tens of
 * milliseconds — and with eight chances per frame instead of two, the TAIL
 * compounds even though the mean barely moves.
 *
 * Measured at 4 bands on a 5K frame: `process` (capture callback entry to send)
 * averaged 15 ms against a 16.7 ms budget, and spiked to 48 ms while a video was
 * playing, against 26-30 ms on ordinary desktop content. Those spikes are what
 * bunches two frames onto the wire together and shifts a 25 fps video's 2,3,2,3
 * pulldown into visible judder.
 *
 * Every band shares one geometry — same width, same height, same tile grid — so
 * the per-band regions of every buffer are a fixed stride apart and the whole
 * frame is one dispatch loop inside one command buffer.
 *
 * `src` points at the FULL frame, not at a band; each band reads from its own
 * row offset. That also restores zero-copy for every band: the caller used to
 * advance the pointer per band, and only a band whose byte offset happened to
 * land on a page boundary could be wrapped without a copy.
 *
 * `out` must have room for `band_count` entries. Returns the total encoded
 * length across all bands, or 0 on failure, in which case `out` is untouched.
 * `band_count` is capped at TB_DPCM_GPU_MAX_BANDS. */

 *
 * `band` is valid only for the duration of the call. `last` is non-zero on the

/* Encode without blocking the calling thread.
 *
 * WHY
 *
 * tb_dpcm_gpu_encode_bands() waits on the GPU twice, and those waits happen on
 * whatever thread called it — for the sender that is ScreenCaptureKit's capture
 * queue, the one thing that must keep up with the display. Measured there:
 * `process` (callback entry to send) ran 13-15 ms against a 16.7 ms period,
 * because the wait is not for our own work but for a GPU shared with
 * WindowServer and whatever the user is watching. With ~2 ms of headroom any
 * spike pushes a frame into the next period, and then two go out together:
 * capture measured a clean 100% while `send` sat at 85-90% with 7% of packets
 * leaving within 8 ms of the previous one.
 *
 * Batching the bands into two submissions cut the round trips from 2N to 2 and
 * bought about 1 ms, which is all it could: the cost was never the number of
 * waits, it was waiting at all.
 *
 * So this submits and returns. The host-side plan step still has to run between
 * the two GPU passes, but it runs on the encoder's own serial queue rather than
 * the caller's, and `done` fires from there too.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP
 *
 * `src` is read by the GPU AFTER this returns, so the caller must keep those
 * pixels alive and unmodified until `done` runs — for a CVPixelBuffer that
 * means holding the lock and a reference, not just the pointer.
 *
 * Returns 0 if the frame was submitted, -1 if it was rejected: bad geometry,
 * unavailable Metal resources, a quarantined encoder, or TB_DPCM_GPU_JOBS
 * frames already in flight. A rejection is ordinary backpressure and the
 * caller should drop the frame; `done` is NOT called.
 *
 * Completion order matches submission order — one command queue, and the plan
 * stage is serial. */
